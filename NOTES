 * how big is a name?  we don't want to let people put in a 2GiB name

 * if we use :controller/:id/:action instead of :controller/:action/:id (for RESTful urls ala flickr and launchpad, then we can't have a user or id anywhere called 'new'.  Perhaps this is why launchpad names their actions '+action'?
