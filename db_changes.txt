2008-09-02 (changes from live to new rego models):
      * Added Ceiling and Product models
       * ceiling is linked to product by ceiling_product_map
       * an invoice_item can optionally have a product
       * added calculation of total qty of a ceiling used (should be seperated into product and ceiling model)
       * added methods to determine whether a product is soldout and how many are remaining
       * Made qty checking code more uniform
           * Added Product Categories
           * Removed registration field from product as it will now be a category
           * Added can_i_sell(person, qty) to Product which checks the limits in the Product and the Products associated ceilings
           * added active field to products
   * Name product_category table correctly
   * Remove all product related fields from registration
   * Add registration<->Product relationship table and class
   * Remove all Accomodation tables as these will be replaced by products and ceilings
   * Remove the pretty much non-existant Accomodation controller
   * Changed VoucherCode to use products
