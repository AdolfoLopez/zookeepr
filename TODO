interface
=========

 * make submissiontype interface accessible only by conf admin

 * sidebar style

 * content body style

 * feet logo

 * date-based release of CFP and Rego on front page requires interfaces to set these conf-wide dates (and other config)
  * how do you test that?

 * CFP review interface with dhtml stars from yahoo site.  must be accessible w/o js though.

 * fix front page for unlogged and logged in users
  - usual front page for unlogged
  - personal summary for logged in users

 * flow of security/signin and signout, redirect to home or show result page?

== "business" logic ==

 * fix cfp submission process

 * email notifications for signup and announcements.

== code refactoring ==

 * With SQLAlchemy 0.2, replace the try/except in Globals.__init__() with engine.create_tables().

 * work out how to autogenerate forms because I'm lazy and writing the templates is fucking tedious and boring

== testing ==

 * throw bad shit at forms to make sure we're using formencode :-)

 * don't use test.ini for the test suite, construct a whole paste config in tests/__init__.py using appconfig or however paste does it
