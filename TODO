= Milestones for 0.1, CFP, 24 May =

== interface ==

= Future milestones =

== interface ==

 * CFP review interface with dhtml stars from yahoo site.  must be accessible w/o js though.

  * Photo

   * FISL rating system
  * when they are accepted, tell them that they need to register for the conference
  * accounts for papers committee 
   * papers committee members sign up
   * administrative interface to tick 

 * Associations
  * timetable handles associations
   * associate with events
   * publicise personal timetable depending on privacy
  * automatically associated with some events: miniconfs, bofs, pdns, speakers dinner
  * "other people who are going to this event are also going to"


== code refactoring ==

 * With SQLAlchemy 0.2, replace the try/except in Globals.__init__() with engine.create_tables().

 * work out how to autogenerate forms because I'm lazy and writing the templates is fucking tedious and boring

== testing ==

 * throw bad shit at forms to make sure we're using formencode :-)

 * don't use test.ini for the test suite, construct a whole paste config in tests/__init__.py using appconfig or however paste does it

 * case where: people sign up for account, go through non-signed in registration, two confirmation emails get sent out, two outstanding confirmation emails on the wire
