 * make submissiontype interface accessible only by conf admin

 * test for error conditions: deleting nonexistent records

 * use FormEncode to validate the input from forms

 * throw bad shit at forms to make sure we're using formencode :-)

 * work out how to autogenerate forms because I'm lazy and writing the templates is fucking tedious and boring

 * refactor the submissiontype and person interfaces to share the common code; CRUD controllers have the same behaviours, but on different objects
