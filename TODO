= TODO =

 * Restrict access to submissions.  Modify SecureController to add authorisation controls. + test obviously.

 * Test submission edits.

 * Test submission deletes.

 * Add ability to add co-speakers to submissions.

== todo from the flight

 * test registration actually creates a person object with it.
   investigate sqlalchemy inherited mappers, see if that's what we want here.
   also look at wether that can be used to collapse the repeated password
   properties

= Milestones for 0.2 =

 * make submissiontype interface accessible only by conf admin
  * apply permissions to all CRUD interfaces. recreate PylonsSecureController to use a class property instead of method properties to controll access so that generics can still work

     * list of submissions
     * submission information
   * User administration
     * list/search, add, modify, delete

= Future milestones =

== interface ==

 * date-based release of CFP and Rego on front page requires interfaces to set these conf-wide dates (and other config)
  * how do you test that?

 * CFP review interface with dhtml stars from yahoo site.  must be accessible w/o js though.

 * cfp upload file, magical js that greys out box if peer reviewed paper not selected

== "business" logic ==

 * register for the conference

 * at the cfp close, the submission is locked, "pens down"

 * Sign up for a login now autofills information for "register"

 * RSS
  * MyLCA public information (events, tags) - no private information (payment, accomodation)
  * URL is md5sum'd
  * Photo

 * Paper Reviewal Interface
  * chair to find out what papers aren't being review
  * reviewers can rate (one to five, 3 vectors) or delegate
   * FISL rating system
  * when they are accepted, tell them that they need to register for the conference
  * accounts for papers committee 
   * papers committee members sign up
   * administrative interface to tick 

 * Associations
  * timetable handles associations
   * associate with events
   * publicise personal timetable depending on privacy
  * automatically associated with some events: miniconfs, bofs, pdns, speakers dinner
  * "other people who are going to this event are also going to"


== code refactoring ==

 * work out how to autogenerate forms because I'm lazy and writing the templates is fucking tedious and boring

 * Remove the evil_jf hack which fixes the sqlalchemy wierdness where _engine disapears

== testing ==

 * throw bad shit at forms to make sure we're using formencode :-)

 * don't use test.ini for the test suite, construct a whole paste config in tests/__init__.py using appconfig or however paste does it

 * case where: people sign up for account, go through non-signed in registration, two confirmation emails get sent out, two outstanding confirmation emails on the wire

 * test validators:
displayname can't be 'new', can't be all numbers, must be urlable, hsouldnt have quoted chars
