 * submission type interface

 * make subtype interface accessible only by conf admin

 * test for error conditions: deleting nonexistent records

 * use FormEncode to validate the input from forms

 * throw bad shit at forms to make sure we're using formencode :-)

 * work out how to autogenerate forms because I'm lazy

 * test that GET can't update or delete or create anything
