 * make submissiontype interface accessible only by conf admin

 * throw bad shit at forms to make sure we're using formencode :-)

 * work out how to autogenerate forms because I'm lazy and writing the templates is fucking tedious and boring

 * With SQLAlchemy 0.2, replace the try/except in Globals.__init__() with engine.create_tables().

 * make account.myc:signin show who's logged in, and a logout button

 * sidebar style

 * content body style

 * feet logo

 * Auth/login - authkit will not be ready.  two options:
  * hack own middleware, with intent to replace with AuthKit in future.
  * no auth, only signup, and do auth after release

 * date-based release of CFP and Rego on front page requires interfaces to set these conf-wide dates (and other config)
  * how do you test that?

 * email notifications for signup and announcements.

 * CFP review interface with dhtml stars from yahoo site.  must be accessible w/o js though.
