obviously you have a checkout of zookeepr

Set up setuptools so you have a 'virtual python' (as described at the easy_install docs at peak.telecommunity.com)

 * As root, you need a /usr/lib/python2.3/site-packages/altinstall.pth which tells python that you have another directory in your sys.path.  it contains:

import os, site; site.addsitedir(os.path.expanduser('~/lib/python2.3'))

 * You also need to tell distutils (which setuptools builds on) where to insall stuff, so make a ~/.pydistutils.cfg with the following contents:

[install]
install_lib = ~/lib/python2.3
install_scripts = ~/bin


Obviously, change paths to suit and make sure they're the same.

 * If you have debian's python-setuptools package installed, chances are it's 0.6a9, which isn't good enough for the `nose` package (the test runner).  We need to install a new setuptools, which we can do with the existing setuptools ;-)

easy_install -U -Z setuptools==0.6a11

(If this didn't work, you can paste the URL to 0.6a11 egg from python's cheeseshop to easy_install in place of the pacakge name and it'll DTRT)
