= page titles =

put in a block like the following
{{{
<%method title>
Something - <& PARENT:title &>
</%method>
}}}
at the bottom of your page if you want to change the title; the
autohandler calls the method SELF:title in each page, which defaults
to putting in the conference name.  You override this by specifying
your own title method in the page.
