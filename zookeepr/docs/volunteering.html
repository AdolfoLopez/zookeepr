There are two aspects to the volunteering system now in zookeepr:
(a) the Volunteer ($0) ticket type, on the rego form, and
(b) the "areas of interest" form: <tt>http://linux.conf.au/registration/volunteer</tt>
<p>
Using either of these marks the person as a volunteer, listed on
<tt>http://linux.conf.au/admin/volunteer_list</tt>
<p>
Any attendee can fill in the "areas of interest" form, the idea being that if 
they've paid and volunteered, they are entitled to attend talks and volunteer 
some of the time.
<p>
The Volunteer ticket type is a normal ticket type that will generate a badge 
of a colour that won't get you in anywhere. It will also steer you toward 
the "areas of interest" form.
<p>
Conversely, the "area of interest" form will steer you toward the Volunteer 
ticket type if you aren't (tentatively) registered. Tentative registrations 
can fill the "areas of interest" form in, they're listed as "(not paid)" on 
the volunteer list.
<p>
To un-volunteer, (a) change ticket type away from Volunteer, and (b) blank out 
the "areas of interest" form (except the phone number, that can stay).
<p>
<p>
The areas of interest on the "areas of interest" form can be changed easily;
just add/remove them in the template. Removing check-boxes is OK, any
unrecognised area will be automatically moved into the "other" box.
