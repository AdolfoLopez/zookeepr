We need to be able to provide a way for controllers to hook into our permissions system:
 * add function (or decorator for python2.4) to controller
 * function returns a dictionary of the permissions of each method

The SecureController can be modified to recognise these permissions and apply restrictions accordingly. 

The controller permissions will be modifiable through the admin interface (through some sort of abstraction).
