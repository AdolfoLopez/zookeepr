CRUD in Zookeepr
++++++++++++++++

Based on the Generics module by Ben Bangert, the `crud` module
contains five base classes that one can inherit from to build a
controller class.

They are:

 * `Create` for creating an object.

 * `Read` for retrieving an object.

 * `Update` for editing/updating an object's data.

 * `Delete` for deleting the object.

 * `List` for listing all objects of this type.

Typically, one mixes these classes together into a child class, like
so:


    class ObjectController(BaseController, Create, Read, Update,
Delete):
	pass

By default, the generics map to the following actions:

Create -> new
Read -> view
Update -> edit
Delete -> delete
List -> index

but these may be overridden using an instance variable known as the
action_map.

    def __init__(self):
	"""Change the action map to create an object when 'submit' is
	called.
	"""
	self.action_map['new'] = 'submit'
