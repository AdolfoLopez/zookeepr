<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Roles are used in zookeepr to give access to various pages and
functions and
generally to distinguish classes of users. <br>

<p>Note: the ID numbers are from 2008; they are generally not
significant and may well be different. Roles are identified by name.<br>
</p>
<h2>Management</h2>
<p>Any organiser can grant and revoke roles (including their own) via
the <tt>/profile</tt>
pages (also known as "person"). Near the bottom, there's a section
heading "Roles" with a "view/change" link.</p>
<p>The roles people have are summarised on the <tt>/admin/auth_users</tt>
page. They are also listed on the <tt>/admin/rego_lookup</tt> and <tt>/admin/rego_list</tt>
pages.<br>
</p>
<h3>Bootstrapping</h3>
<p>Initially, nobody has any role. To bootstrap the system, go into
the
database and insert the appropriate pair of ID numbers into <tt>person_role_map</tt>
to give yourself the <tt>organiser</tt> role.
</p>
<p>Note: you may also need to insert the roles into the <tt>role</tt>
table in the database; zookeepr populates the table on initialization,
but the
list of roles in the init may lag behind the actual list of roles used
in the code; and in any case if you add a role to a live system, you
will need to add it to the <tt>role</tt> table by hand.<br>
</p>
<h2>Other sources of permission and distinction<br>
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The <b>creator</b> of an object (for instance, people can edit
their own registration data).</li>
  <li>The Mini-conf organiser ($0) ticket type is <b>hard-coded by ID</b>
in the registration controller. This <i>should be refactored</i> to
use either the existing <tt>miniconf</tt> role or a new role dedicated
to this purpose. Sorry about that, guys, that was an error on my
(Jiri's) part.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Accepted proposals (aka talks)</b> give speaker powers
throughout the system.</li>
  <li><b>Paid or zero invoices</b> are used to distinguish paid
registrations (usually with an exception for speakers), but a paid
invoice also disallows editing registration data.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Voucher codes</b> (previously known as <b>Discount codes</b>) are
  used to give people who have not yet registered a limited range of powers
  during registration:<br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>free registration, with a 100% voucher code</li>
    <li>free registration as media, with a 100% voucher code that
starts with the string MEDIA</li>
    <li>discounted registration, eg 20% to give effectively earlybird
rates after close of earlybird<br>
    </li>
    <li>normal registration after regos have otherwise closed, with a
0% voucher code.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>In <tt>/admin/speaker_dinner_list</tt> there's a <b>hard-coded
name</b> added to the list (with no reference to an account).</li>
</ul>
