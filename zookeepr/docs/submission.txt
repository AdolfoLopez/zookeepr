submission process

goals:

 * submission form takes in details
 * at end of submission we should have:
   * submisison data (title, etc)
   * an account (email address, password)
   * a registration linked to this account

we need to be able to accept multiple submissions from the same email
address.

current objects look like:

 account + person tables => person object
 account + registration tables => registration object
 account + person + submission => CFP object

currently this falls down because the account has a requirement for a
uique email address.

also falls down ebcause a person isn't created with a registration,
and a rego isn't created with a submission.


suggested course of action

* i don't want to join the person and account details, but it looks
like it is necessary to make that just work.

* the submisison and registration creation shouldn't be linked in a
single model object CFP, unless the CFP is a superset of
both... having a single model makes the use of generics crud very
easy, otherwise we'd need a way to hook in model creation to cope with
the crosslinks in the two model objects.  that said, i think if the
registration contains a person and rego table, and person is now
account too, then this should just work.

* the lsat note falls down again at multiple submission; we do
actually want to cope with the case where a
registration/person/account already exists and allow them a second
submission.  it's a bit dodgy though, to accept a password twice.
