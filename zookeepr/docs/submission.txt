submission process

goals:

 * submission form takes in details
 * at end of submission we should have:
   * submisison data (title, etc)
   * an account (email address, password)
   * a registration linked to this account

we need to be able to accept multiple submissions from the same email
address.

current objects look like:

 account + person tables => person object
 account + registration tables => registration object
 account + person + submission => CFP object

currently this falls down because the account has a requirement for a
uique email address.

also falls down ebcause a person isn't created with a registration,
and a rego isn't created with a submission.
