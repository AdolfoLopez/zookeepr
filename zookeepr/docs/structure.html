<h2>How a request is handled</h2>
<ul>
  <li>First it goes into <tt>config/middleware.py</tt> which does
various miscellaneous stuff, loading the config and environment,
filtering error messages etc. The <tt>/pony</tt> page is also diverted
here.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The vast majority of requests then goes to <tt>config/routing.py</tt>
where they're translated into a controller, action and (often) ID.<br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>The controllers are in the <tt>controllers</tt> directory, and
the action is used as a method name. If there is an ID, it's provided
to the method in <tt>self.obj</tt></li>
  </ul>
  <li>Other sources of data are the two directory hierarchies, <tt>public</tt>
and <tt>template/content</tt><tt><br>
    </tt></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Files in the <tt>public</tt> directory are simply served, as
they are. This is mostly suitable for non-html files, like images,
stylesheets etc. The code responsible for this is in <tt>config/middleware.py</tt>
using <tt>StaticURLParser</tt> </li>
    <li>Files in <tt>&#65279;templates/content</tt> are run through the
templating system, which means that &#65279;they (a) get the standard headers
and (b) can use the myghty templating directives. This is sutiable for
static html files that should get the standard styling, navigation,
etc. The code responsible for this is the <tt>content</tt> controller
in <tt>controllers/content.py</tt><br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h2>Controllers</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Controllers are in the <tt>controllers</tt> directory in
appropriately-named files. For instance, the registration controller is
in <tt>controllers/registration.py</tt> and is called <tt>RegistrationController</tt>.
The corresponding template files are in the <tt>templates/registration</tt>
directory.<br>
  </li>
  <li>They inherit from BaseController or SecureController; generally
speaking, they should now all inherit from SecureController since it
can now handle publicly-accessible pages.</li>
  <li>"CRUD" - Create, Read, Update, Delete (and List) are mix-ins,
which add standard actions to the controller. They're defined in <tt>lib/crud.py</tt><br>
  </li>
  <li>The "admin" controller is my (Jiri's) place for random bits of
functionality.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Everything in <tt>admin.py</tt> (other than the <tt>index</tt>
action) is therefore a candidate for re-factoring elsewhere.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h2>Data model<br>
</h2>
The data model is defined in the <tt>model</tt> directory. It is
broken up into conceptual submodules:<br>
<dl>
  <dt>core</dt>
  <dd>persons, roles, password reset confirmations<br>
  </dd>
  <dt>billing</dt>
  <dd>invoices, payments, voucher codes<br>
  </dd>
  <dt>openday</dt>
  <dd> (no idea)<br>
  </dd>
  <dt>proposal</dt>
  <dd>proposals (incl. assistance requirements, attachments), reviews<br>
  </dd>
  <dt>registration</dt>
  <dd>registration, accommodation<br>
  </dd>
  <dt>schedule</dt>
  <dd> (no idea, I think this is skeleton-only, never implemented)<br>
  </dd>
</dl>
Within each submodule, the data model is broken up into an MVC-like
pattern (which is heavily supported by the SQLAlchemy ORM):
<dl>
  <dt><tt>tables.py</tt></dt>
  <dd>SQLAlchemy table schema definition, the 'model' of
the model. </dd>
  <dt><tt>domain.py</tt></dt>
  <dd>Python classes representing the data model we want to
present
to the application, the 'view' of the model. </dd>
  <dt><tt>mapper.py</tt></dt>
  <dd>The heavy lifting, which maps the table schemas to
the view layer, i.e. the 'controller' of the model. </dd>
  <dt><tt>__init__.py</tt></dt>
  <dd>Exposes only the Python classes to the application. </dd>
</dl>
