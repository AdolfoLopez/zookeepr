<h2>Call for Participation</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
Members of the Linux and open-source community are invited to submit
papers and proposals for presentations, tutorials and mini-confs for
linux.conf.au 2007.
</p>

<p>
Presentations are the main part of the conference and consist of a 40
minute talk followed by 10 minutes for questions. Presentations provide
an an ideal opportunity to present a new technology or idea to the
community.
</p>

<p>
Papers related to their presentation can be submitted by academics who
are accepted to give a presentation in the conference. These papers
are peer-reviewed by an international papers committee. Papers will be
included in the conference proceedings. The papers track allows
students, researchers and academics to have their work formally
recognised.
</p>

<p>
Tutorials are half-day presentations which provide an opportunity to
provide an in-depth and hands on look at a specific technology. These 
tutorials should be interactive, and the level of expertise required by
participants should be clear so people can choose tutorials appropriate
to their level.
