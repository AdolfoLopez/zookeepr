<h1 class="pop">A tasty ingredient in the linux.conf.au recipe.</h1>

<p>The mini-conferences are dedicated conference streams for specific 
communities of interest. The linux.conf.au organisers provide the space, 
and leave the rest up to the organiser of each mini-conf.</p>

<p>Mini-conf speakers and delegates need to register for the main 
conference to participate.</p>
