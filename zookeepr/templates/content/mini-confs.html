<h1 class="pop">A tasty ingredient in the linux.conf.au recipe.</h1>

<p>The mini-conferences are dedicated conference streams for specific 
communities of interest. The linux.conf.au organisers provide the space, 
and leave the rest up to the organiser of each mini-conf.</p>

<p>Mini-conf speakers and delegates need to register for the main 
conference to participate.</p>

<p>We now invite members of the linux and open source community to 
<a href="/mini-confs/submit_mini-conf_proposal">submit a proposal</a> to run
a mini-conf during linux.conf.au MEL<span class="eight">8</span>OURNE2008.</p>
