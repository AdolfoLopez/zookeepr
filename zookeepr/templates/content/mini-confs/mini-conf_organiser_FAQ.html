<h2>Important restrictions</h2>

<h3>Part of linux.conf.au</h3>

<p>Mini-confs run as part of the linux.conf.au conference programme. Thus, when
submitting a miniconference you agree that if accepted, you will organise your
miniconference to suit the venue and timetable provided by the linux.conf.au
organisers. We particularly ask that all miniconferences observe the timetable
provided by organisers, so that attendees can move between mini-confs.</p>

<h3>Sponsorship</h3>

<p>Please do not separately organise sponsorship for your mini-conf.

If you think there would be sponsor interest in your miniconference, please
contact our sponsorship team at <a
href="mailto:sponsors@mel8ourne.org">sponsors@mel8ourne.org</a>, who will then
discuss with you appropriate arrangements and act as a single contact point for
the sponsors. Do not approach sponsors directly, and if you receive direct
inquiries, re-direct them to <a
href="mailto:sponsors@mel8ourne.org">sponsors@mel8ourne.org</a> or the <a
href="/2008/sponsors-media">Sponsors page</a>. Failure to do this may
jeopardise linux.conf.au's relationship with all sponsors, and may result in
your miniconference being cancelled.</p>

<h3>Advertising</h3>

<p>Due to advertising restrictions with our sponsors, your
mini-conf may not display or distribute banners, posters, leaflets
or other advertising material without prior written agreement from the
linux.conf.au organising team. You may organise the design and sale of
shirts or clothing provided that this clothing is specific to your
miniconf (eg "so-and-so miniconf" not "so-and-so project").</p>
