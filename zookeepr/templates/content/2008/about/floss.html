<h1 class="pop">FLOSS - to keep your computer clean.</h1>

<p><span class="subhead">Free, Libre and Open Source software is about liberty, rather than price.</span></p>

<p>The Free Software Foundation (FSF) was established in 1985, to promote the rights of computer users to use, study, copy, modify, and redistribute computer programs.</p>

<p>The Open Source Initiative (OSI) is a non-profit corporation dedicated to managing and promoting the Open Source Definition.</p>

<p>The term 'Libre' is used to reinforce the meaning of 'Free' as in liberty, not free as in cost. The English language uses Free in many 
contexts, where other languages distinguish using words such as libre, and gratis.</p>
