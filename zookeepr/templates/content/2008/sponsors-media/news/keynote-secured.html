<h1 class="pop">linux.conf.au 2008 - Keynote Secured</h1>

<h3>Press Release: Monday 2 July 2007, Melbourne, Australia.</h3>

<p>Team Mel8ourne announces their first keynote speaker and Emperor sponsor for linux.conf.au 2008. With seven months to go, they're busy putting all the pieces together to put on Australia's largest conference for Free and Open Source Software contributors. This is the pre-eminent event for the Australian Free and Open Source Software community.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.schneier.com/">Bruce Schneier</a>, a highly 
respected author and security technologist, will deliver a keynote address at the conference in January 2008 at the University of Melbourne.</p>

<p>The call for proposals for linux.conf.au 2008 opened on June 1st, and will close on Friday July 20. Donna Benjamin, Conference Director says &quot;We're astounded by the response to the call to participate in LCA2008. We've already had 15 proposals for mini-confs, and there are whispers a few more proposals are on their way. People have also started submitting talks and tutorials for the main conference, and we expect these to start flooding in now, with less than 4 weeks left until we close the call for presentations.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Putting on a conference of this scale is an enormous challenge,&quot; said Benjamin, &quot;it's only made possible with the support of key sponsors focused on developing the Open Source industry. IBM is a long standing supporter of linux.conf.au, and I'm really pleased to announce they're behind us for linux.conf.au 2008 in Melbourne next year.&quot;</p>

<p>Hugh Blemings, Open Source Hacker at <a href="http://www.ibm.com/au/">IBM A/NZ</a> said &quot;IBM's continuing commitment to Linux and the Open Source Community is key to our strategy to make open standards-based Linux hardware software and services more accessible. Our involvement is extensive, with around 900 engineers across 40 locations worldwide contributing to open source community projects and events.&quot;</p>

<p>linux.conf.au is an initiative of Linux Australia, and is run each year by a different team of volunteers, in a different Australasian city. In 2008, the conference returns to its birthplace in Melbourne. From January 28 to February 2, the University of Melbourne will be the location for one of the world's most brilliant gatherings of Free and Open Source Software developers, users and devotees.</p>
