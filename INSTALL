Install instructions.

Here be the way of getting zookeepr going.
This be instructions for Ubuntu 8.04. Main reason for this is so we can use apt to get the 
latest (for now) versions of python, pylons and all that jazz. Plus being an LTS release we felt that
this would be a good platform to deploy on.

This document is most likely incomplete. I'm trying to make the install as minimal as possible but I probably have packages
installed on my machine that I forgot to list down here.

====== Dependencies ======
I'm not a fan of of eggs (well... not fried, but poached are nice).
So, start by getting the usual junk. These were all installed via apt-get. Generally these were for python2.5, but 2.4 may work.

sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pylons python-sqlalchemy python-simplejson python-setuptools python-dnspython python-cheetah python-psycopg2

====== Installing and setting up Zookeepr ======

From within zookeepr:
 - May have to run this: "sudo python setup.py develop"
   (Although you should already have everything the setup.py installs... Try without this first).
From within zookeepr/zookeepr:
 - Install zookeepr using easy_install: "sudo easy_install zookeepr"
 - Make a config file as follows: "paster make-config zookeepr config.ini"
 - Tweak config.ini file as appropriate 
     - Set up dburi to something appropriate (possibly sqlite:/// or a postgre setup).
 - Generate an empty database: "paster setup-app config.ini"
 
====== Running Zookeepr ======
paster serve --reload -v config.ini
