## Installing and setting up Zookeepr ##

 - Change directories into zookeepr (Where this `INSTALL` file is):

		pylons # not available/needed on Debian or Ubuntu
		python setup.py develop

 - Make a config file as follows (you may skip this step and use the supplied
   `development.ini`):

		paster make-config zookeepr config.ini

 - Tweak `config.ini` file as appropriate: 
   * Set up `dburi` to something appropriate (possibly `sqlite:///` for SQLite3
       or `postgres://` for a PostgreSQL setup).

 - Generate an empty database:

		paster setup-app config.ini

 - To easily regenerate the database during development check out:

		bin/reset-development-db
 
## Running Zookeepr ##

	paster serve --reload -v config.ini

## Administering Zookeepr ##

 - A default admin account exists with the following credentials:

   email:    `admin@zookeepr.org`  
   password: `password`

 - By visiting <http://127.0.0.1:5000/admin> you will be prompted to log in and
   redirected to the administration hub.

 - Be sure to update/delete this user before deploying!
