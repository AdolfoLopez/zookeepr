This document details how to set up the zookeepr development environment, installing zookeepr, and running zookeepr.

====== Setting up the development environment for Python 2.4 ======

These steps will set up the development environment under Ubuntu Dapper in your home directory. It assumes that you have sudo access to your machine. 

Requirements:
 * Ubuntu Dapper
 * bzr installed

Steps:
 * Remove python-setuptools, python2.4-setuptools if they are installed
 * Check that python2.4-dev, python2.4-profiler, python-pysqlite2, python2.4-paramiko are installed
 * Download virtual Python from http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/virtual-python.py. 
 * Run `python virtual-python.py`. This will set up a Python installation in your home directory.
 * Download ez_setup.py from http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py
 * Run python `ez_setup.py`. This will install setup_tool, the Python package manager.
 * Check out zookeepr `bzr branch http://repo.spacepants.org/zookeepr/zookeepr.dev zookeepr`
 * run `python setup.py develop` from within the zookeepr source tree. This will pull down all necessary dependencies for zookeepr
 * run `nosetests` to see whether you have any libraries missing

====== Installing and setting up Zookeepr ======

From within zookeepr/zookeepr:
 * Install zookeepr using easy_install: `easy_install zookeepr`
 * Make a config file as follows: `paster make-config zookeepr config.ini`
 * Tweak config.ini file as appropriate 
 * Setup the application: `paster setup-app config.ini`

You are good to go!

====== Running zookeepr ======

From within zookeepr/
 * Run `paster server -v --reload development.ini`
 * Point your browser to http://localhost:5000/

====== How to start hacking ======

 * Refer to the docstrings to familiarise yourself with the code
 * PEP-8 is your new god. PyLint can be used to enforce it. Refer to http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
 * run `nosetests --stop` from within zookeepr source tree to get an initial starting point on all bugs you should be fixing


====== Testing ======

Run `nosetests` to run the test suite.  They must ust pass all the time or else!

 * `nosetests` - runs all tests
 * `nosetests --stop` - runs all tests and stops at the first error
 * `nosetests -sv` - print output as zookeer installs
