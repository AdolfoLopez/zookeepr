== Install instructions. ==

Here be the way of getting zookeepr going.

This be instructions for Ubuntu 8.04. Main reason for this is so we can use apt
to get the latest (for now) versions of python, pylons and all that jazz. Plus
being an LTS release we felt that this would be a good platform to deploy on.

====== Dependencies ======

// Fixme: I think with pylons 0.7 as we are using the go-pylons script we don't need all these deps...

aptitude install python-dev python-pylons python-sqlalchemy python-simplejson \
    python-libxml2 python-xsltproc python-setuptools python-dnspython python-cheetah \
    python-psycopg2 miscfiles pwgen python-myghty

For Ubuntu Hardy add from Jaunty:

  javascript-common 5
  libjs-prototype 1.6.0.3-1
  python-webhelpers 0.6.4-1
  wwwconfig-common 0.2.1

For Debian Lenny, you must downgrade these packages:

  python-pylons down to 0.9.6.1-1
  python-beaker down to 0.8-1

====== PDF generation ======

You need to follow these steps for PDF generation to work:

 - Install Deps:
     * aptitude install inkscape

====== Keysigning code ======

To allow the generation of key fingerprint pages you will need to install the following packages:
 * aptitude install gnupg mpage ghostscript

====== Installing and setting up Zookeepr ======

 - Install latest pylons in a development directory:
     * mkdir pylons && cd pylons
     * wget http://www.pylonshq.com/download/0.9.7/go-pylons.py
     * python go-pylons.py ./
     * alias pylons="source `pwd`/bin/activate"
 
 - Change directories into zookeepr (Where this INSTALL file is):
    * pylons
    * python setup.py develop

 - Make a config file as follows (you may skip this step and use the supplied development.ini):
     paster make-config zookeepr config.ini

 - Tweak config.ini file as appropriate 
     - Set up dburi to something appropriate (possibly sqlite:/// or a postgre setup).

 - Generate an empty database: "paster setup-app config.ini"
 
====== Running Zookeepr ======

paster serve --reload -v config.ini

====== Administering Zookeepr ======
 - A default admin account exists with the following credentials:
   email:    admin@zookeepr.org
   password: password
 - By visiting http://127.0.0.1:5000/admin you will be prompted to log in and redirected to the administration hub.
 - Be sure to update/delete this user before deploying!
